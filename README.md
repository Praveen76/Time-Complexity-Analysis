# Time Complexity Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the concept of computational complexity, focusing on time complexity and Big-O notation. It aims to help you understand these fundamental concepts and determine the time complexity of given algorithms.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this experiment, you will be able to:

- Understand the concept of computational complexity
- Understand time complexity, Big-O notation, and their importance in developing algorithms
- Determine the time complexity of given algorithms

## Files

- **Time_Complexity.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook file that contains the code and explanations for understanding and analyzing time complexity.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install Jupyter Notebook using `pip`:

```sh
pip install notebook
```

### Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/Time-Complexity-Analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

```sh
cd Time-Complexity-Analysis
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the `Time_Complexity.ipynb` notebook and run the cells to explore the concepts of time complexity and Big-O notation.
